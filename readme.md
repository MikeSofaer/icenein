##Community Knowledge Sharing Tool

This is a tool for sharing knowledge about where ICE activity is happening, or it would be if it worked.

##Is it legal?

That's what my lawyer friends tell me so far.

##Is it moral?

Immigration adminstrative procedure as it relates to central America is a 14th ammendment
violation writ large. Billed as border control, it is actully an end-run around worker protection
law. Opposing it until its inevitable overturning is moral.
